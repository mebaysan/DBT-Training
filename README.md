# DBT-Training
I created this repo to follow [official training paths of DBT](https://courses.getdbt.com/collections) 


[`dbt-Fundamentals`](./dbt-Fundamentals/) folder is created for following the courses

I used [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) instead of dbt Cloud

Also, that folder has a [lab](./dbt-Fundamentals/lab/) which is created by Docker to simulate the warehouse
