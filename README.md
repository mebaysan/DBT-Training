# DBT-Training
I created this repo to follow official training paths of DBT


# Courses

1.  [dbt Fundamentals](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals) & [Analyses and Seeds](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/analyses-seeds)
    - [`dbt-Fundamentals`](./dbt-Fundamentals/) folder is created for following this course
    - I used [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) instead of dbt Cloud
    - Also, that folder has a lab which is created by Docker to simulate the warehouse
